its been 5 months since DJV2, it was unironically peak coding experience, comeback is soon, but with 5 months of experience
i honestly dont know if im gonna make it python or not, i alr have like 1500 lines of python for DJV3 written but i really want it to be powerful
yeah ill js stick to the python ill fry my brain relearning cpp
maybe ill do cs idk
yea im doing python with a QT ui just like DJV2, except i actually know a little design now
on a random note you guys are sleeping on cursor i swear the coding ai is so good
